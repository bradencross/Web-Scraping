# Web-Scraping

This project is to practice web scraping, using github, and machine learning.

So far there are two web scrapers in development:
1. Real estate web scraper that gathers homes for sale off a canadian website points2homes 
  - Homes are grabbed in the winnipeg area
  - then each home is scraped for details such as number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage etc.
2. Web scraper that grabs the top 100 software development jobs in Victoria
  - jobs are grabbed from indeed.com
  - rating and company and job title are displayed


No further work is played for the job web scraper.

Planned work for the real estate scraper is to:
- aggregate data into a machine learning input file
- create a neural network that accepts home parameters and outputs expected market price

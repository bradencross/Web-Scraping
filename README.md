# Web-Scraping

This project is to practice web scraping, using github, and machine learning.

So far there are two web scrapers in development:
1. Real estate web
  - Homes for sale are grabbed in the winnipeg area from point2homes.com (No affiliation)
  - Each home is scraped for details such as number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage etc.
  
2. Software Jobs (No planned upgrades)
  - Software developer jobs are grabbed from indeed.com
  - Rating, company name and job title are scraped
  - Possibly add tracking to see how long it takes to fill job

#TODO:
- [ ] Scrape links of top 1000 homes for sale
- [ ] Decide what home data should be gathered
- [ ] Aggregate data into single file
- [ ] Create basic neural network 
- [ ] Optimize neural network
- [ ] Determine how much to sell your house for!
